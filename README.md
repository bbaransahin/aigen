# Aigen
Aigen is a command line tool to communicate with ChatGPT. I was using ChatGPT plus for $20 monthly. Than I thought maybe API could be cheaper in my case. Also this way I can implement some applications to make my work environment even more interacted with the brand new AI models.

## Status
It is on development right now.
